# CompExonSpace  
Paper: Specificity and exon target space of splicing modifying compounds

This repository contains all R and Python code used to perform the analyses and plot figures published in the manuscript 'Specificity and exon target space of splicing modifying compounds'. The reference genome used throughout all analyses is the assembly GRCh38 downloaded from ENSEMBL.

To ensure reproducibility this project uses:

- **renv** for R  
- **conda** for Python  
- **Zenodo-hosted processed datasets**  
- **SRA raw sequencing data** (no longer required to reproduce figures)

# Installation

## 1. R environment (renv)

Make sure you are inside the project directory, then run:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

This recreates the exact R package versions used for all `.Rmd` analyses.

---

## 2. Python environment (conda)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate comp-exon-space
```

This installs all dependencies needed to run the Python notebooks in `Python/`.

---

# Data Availability

## 1. Raw RNA‑seq Data (SRA)

The RNA‑seq datasets used in this study are available at:

NCBI SRA BioProject: PRJNA1293306

The BioProject contains all SRR run accessions produced for this study.  
To obtain a list of all SRR runs do this:

```bash
esearch -db sra -query PRJNA1293306 | efetch -format runinfo > runinfo.csv
```

Raw FASTQ files are not needed to reproduce the figures in this repository, but can be downloaded like this:

```bash
prefetch SRRXXXXXXX
fasterq-dump SRRXXXXXXX
```

For full reproducibility of the analyses performed here, processed data from Zenodo are sufficient.

---

## 2. Processed Data (Zenodo)

Processed datasets necessary to reproduce every figure (e.g., PSI matrices, exon-level summaries, ML input tables) are available on Zenodo:

Zenodo record: https://zenodo.org/records/18416225

Download and extract:

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/18416225/files/data.zip
unzip data.zip
```

The data archive contains:

```
data/
├── exon_diff/
├── psi_persample/
├── psi_pergasplicesite/
├── ML/
└── ... additional processed files
```

---

# Set the Data Path (`MYDATA`)

The scripts refer to the processed data through the environment variable `MYDATA`.

To set this do:

```r
Sys.setenv(MYDATA = "/path/to/data")
```

After the dowload the directory should look like:

```
$MYDATA/
   exon_diff/
   psi_persample/
   psi_pergasplicesite/
   ML/
   ...
```

Scripts such as:

```r
run_ga_pca(exp_id, data_dir = Sys.getenv("MYDATA"))
```

will automatically load data from this location.

---

## Python notebooks

Launch Jupyter inside the conda environment:

```bash
conda activate comp-exon-space
jupyter notebook
```

Open any notebook in `Python/`, e.g.:

- `SHAPanalysis.ipynb`
- `comparisonROC.ipynb`
- `ESE_ESS_PSIcorrelation.ipynb`
